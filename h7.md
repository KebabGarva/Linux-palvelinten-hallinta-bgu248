# WORK IN PROGRESS: Salt module to make it easy for Linux beginners to setup Fedora 40 with Nvidia drivers working with SecureBoot.

This is a module that is heavily inspired by roworu's guide to install Nvidia drivers that work with SecureBoot on. If you want to star this module, please show some love for them by [starring their guide](https://github.com/roworu/nvidia-fedora-secureboot)!

## Why Fedora 40 and not Nobara.

### TL;DR

Use this module if you think Nobara isn't for you but you still want to have the option to play games on Linux with SecureBoot on without stressful tinkering for a long time. 

#### Longer explanation

Even though Nobara makes it easy to setup Linux for gaming without any tinkering, the reasons are very self-explanatory at least for me:

- ***SecureBoot needs to be turned OFF for Nobara***
- Nobara is directed heavily towards people who just want to use the distro for gaming only
  - Not an universal solution for everyone
  - "Too gamer-distro for regular user"
- Fedora 40 is more
  - secure
  - supported
  - **universally faster**

The point of the module is to automatically make sure that all preconditions for setuping Fedora properly for gaming have been met and then doing all necessary installations and commands.
This will save beginners a lot of time and from massive headaches.

## The salt-modules step-by-step actions explained
