# WORK IN PROGRESS: Salt module to make it easy for Linux beginners to setup Fedora 40 with Nvidia drivers working with SecureBoot.

This is a module that is heavily inspired by roworu's guide to install Nvidia drivers that work with SecureBoot on. If you want to star this module, please show some love for them by [starring their guide](https://github.com/roworu/nvidia-fedora-secureboot)!

If you're a beginner to Linux and you want to make your games run smoothly, you've come to the right place! Follow these steps to get started!

## How to install salt-minion and copy the module to make the commands work.

If you want to get to know Salt and about its operation, click [this link](https://github.com/KebabGarva/Linux-palvelinten-hallinta-bgu248/edit/main/h7.md) to see introduction to Salt.

Feel free to copy-paste these commands, because I explain what these commands do.

And for you, absolute Linux beginners, you use `sudo` when you need to run commands with administrator privileges. 

**Step 1: Install the salt-minion**

This installs the salt using Fedora's default package manager dnf. The option "-y" means that it automatically accepts the installation without having to press the y button manually.

```
sudo dnf install -y salt-minion
```
**Step 2: Making the states work**

First command makes sure that your user is in their home directory. The second command clones my repository using git, which is hands-down the best version manager software and installed ready with your Fedora 40. The third command makes a new directory with "-p" flag that will create the directory regardless if directory `/srv/` doesn't exist yet. The fourth command copies the cloned repository to the salt-directory.

```
cd
```
```
git clone
```
```
sudo mkdir -p /srv/salt
```
```
sudo cp -r salt-nvidia-secureboot/* /srv/salt/
```

**Step 3: Test if the module works**

Run this following command to make sure that the module works as intended. The specified state makes a `helloworld.txt` file in `/home/` folder. If the file is there, you're good to go. Salt will let you know if the file has been made, if it already exists or the module doesn't work.

```
sudo salt-call --local -l info state.apply test
```
This is what should happen if you've followed :

## Why Fedora 40 and not Nobara.

### TL;DR

Use this module if you think Nobara isn't for you but you still want to have the option to play games on Linux with SecureBoot on without stressful tinkering for a long time. 

#### Longer explanation

Even though Nobara makes it easy to setup Linux for gaming without any tinkering, the reasons are very self-explanatory at least for me:

- ***SecureBoot needs to be turned OFF for Nobara***
- Nobara is directed heavily towards people who just want to use the distro for gaming only
  - Not an universal solution for everyone
  - "Too gamer-distro for regular user"
- Fedora 40 is more
  - secure
  - supported
  - **universally faster**

The point of the module is to automatically make sure that all preconditions for setuping Fedora properly for gaming have been met and then doing all necessary installations and commands.
This will save beginners a lot of time and from massive headaches.

## The salt-modules step-by-step actions explained

### Inital setup

- Make sure that SecureBoot is on
  - If it's not on, you need to turn it on through BIOS setting.
- All older Nvidia installations have been uninstalled

### Adding repos and reboot

- Adding rpmfusion repos
  - free
  - nonfree
- Full update of system
- Reboot

### Generating and importing key

- Generating the key
- Importing the key
  - Create a password that you'll remember
- Reboot
  - After reboot, insert the password in MOK manager

### Installing Nvidia drivers 

- There's an optional module that installs Nvidia and Cuda drivers, but you need to make sure that your GPU supports Cuda.

### Check that the built modules run kernel & boot image status

- If they run Kernel, console prints out "You're good to go!"
  - Else the console prints out "Modules built aren't running kernel"
- Rechecking boot image update

### Optional step to install not necessary but VERY USEFUL tools

- Install
  - Vesktop (Discord client that actually works)
  - Gnome Extension manager (get to customize your desktop enviroment to look exactly how you want it)
    - Check [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE1-W2bMVEs) to help you pick extensions.
  - Steam
  - ProtonUp-Qt (GUI to install Wine- and Proton-based compability tools)
  - Lutris (universal game launcher)
  - Mangohud (overlay for monitoring FPS)
  - Goverlay (GUI to customize the Mangohud config file)

Remember to ***CHOOSE GNOME ON XORG*** in the lock screen settings that is located in the ***right-bottom corner***.

Firstly, I made a seperate partition
